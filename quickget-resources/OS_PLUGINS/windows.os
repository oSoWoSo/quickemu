# Instructions: 
# 1. Set mandatory variables below, and set recommended variables if possible
# 2. Modify fetch_info function to include all of the necessary information (or way to fetch it)
# 3. Modify list_urls function to provide ISO(s) for the operating system
# 4. Check out the optional variables below the list_urls function to see if you have a use for any of them
# 5. If necessary, modify config_additions and/or prepare_image functions if you need it for your OS.

# MANDATORY VARIABLES: You must set these to appropriate values for your OS.
